The first step in creating a program should be declaration of variables.
We know that the algorithm operates on 2 variables
for which it is looking for a divisor,
and we also know that the numbers are integers. 
Create and assign them default values.
The next step is to create a while loop that will last until the end of finding the common divisor of 2 variables.
Inside the while loop, use the if and else conditions and the -= operator. 
Thanks to this, our program will perform the operation a = a - b, i.e. 
it will reduce the value of a by the value of b and assign it to the variable a
